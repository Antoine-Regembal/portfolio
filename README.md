# Hi, this is the repository of my personal website.

# This website is under construction

I voluntarily left this repository public under MIT licence in order to allow each person to clone or fork this project, modify it, improve it and I hope, to help others learning React despite the fact the code may not be the best you can find on the internet.

If you clone this project and create improvements, a pull request would be appreciated :) 

Antoine
